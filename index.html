    # The Strangest Belief

    ## Chapter One

    From the day we are born to the day we die, we are competition bound. A high test score only has meaning when the
    test itself is hard, with others earning lower scores. Likewise, winning a game of baseball only has meaning when
    the other team loses. To put it simply, the losses of others are accepted as long as we aren't the ones who lose.

    So shouldn't the selfish thrive? Well, not necessary. We live in a society where cooperation
    is also rewarded, and by extension, altruism. Now, the answer of _why_ is
    pretty obvious, as we are a brainy species. Namely, our ability to communicate and trade information is why we can
    avoid constant conflict. But with all things created, cooperation had to start _somewhere_. Perhaps we can find out
    with the _purple
    pigeons_

    Now let me be clear here. Humans and animals aren't the same. But animals sure do tell a lot about humans. As stated
    before, humans are quite brainy, and by extension, are quite complicated too. There are multiple safeguards in our
    society to prevent against the grubber, and beyond that, we feel complex emotions : We feel anger, gratitude,
    sympathy, guilt, and shame. The average pigeon on the other hand feels none of these things : It'll quite literally
    do anything, without shame, to eat and live. Thus, we can view cooperation at its most primal. Through the eyes of
    the average birdbrain, maybe we find out more about our brains.

    ### Game 1 - Meet the pigeon (Start, seeds, bird reproduces every time it eats two seeds for each cycle)

    Alright, so things seem pretty basic right now - The pigeon sees some seed, so it indulges in it, and the other
    pigeons replicate this behavior. Soon enough, we can see the population grow, as the pigeons eat. Now, let's add a
    requirement - Cooperation

    ### Game 2

    As we can see now, two pigeons each have to go to a tree, and work together to shake the tree in order to get the
    food. After, each blue pigeon shares the seed each tree drops.
    Okay, things are still shaping up. Pigeons who work together get to thrive. Everybody is thriving, so there's no
    reason for selfishness, right?

    ### Game 3 - Evil pigeon takes all food, dominates population.

    Oops, looks like the evil red pigeons won. Instead of sharing the seeds, the red pigeons exploit the blue pigeons.
    Sure, when the red pigeons go up against each other, they don't do too well, but other than that, they usually
    dominate their blue counterparts. Now, let's see this simulation replicated over different blue to red pigeon ratios

    ### Model 1 - Various tests

    It's clear that the majority group is usually the one who thrives in the end, so why does this happen? You would
    think that with more blue pigeons to take advantage of, the red pigeons would do better, but alas, this doesn't seem
    to be true. To put it simply, the blue pigeons are able to thrive more when there are more blue pigeons to work
    together with. On the other hand, red pigeons thrive when there are other red pigeons, _but only_ because these red
    pigeons take advantage of the blue pigeons when there are blue pigeons, eliminating cooperation altogether.

    Furthermore, because these red pigeons always come away with the least amount of seed when they encounter each
    other, they barely thrive.
    The biggest flaw of the pigeons is that they don't recognize when they're playing a losing game. They always stick
    to their same actions, even if they are constantly being taken advantage of, or rather, if the strategy offers no
    substantial return. This is basically what *Evolutionary Game Theory* is - The actions these pigeons will take have
    been decided by the way the pigeon is built. The pigeon makes no conscious decision to decide what to do, but
    rather, it does so because it _has_ to. If we were to apply this to a *Game Theory* context, these pigeons will be
    able to decide what to do, rather than just simply _doing_.

    ## Chapter Two

    Grudges - Purple pigeon acts like the blue pigeon normally, but will remember pigeons who betray them.

    Here's the purple pigeon. Unlike the blue or red pigeon, it pulls off a strategy in which it acts like a blue
    pigeon, but once a pigeon betrays it, this pigeon will retaliate with a red-pigeon strategy.

    Game 3 - With some grudge pigeons.
    By working with the blue pigeons and avoiding the red pigeons, we can see that Purple pigeons does quite well. Now,
    let's see its behavior with multiple situations.

    Model 2 - + Grudge Pigeon

    Unsurprisingly, the purple pigeon does quite well here too! Even when there's no blue pigeons to work with, the
    purple pigeons are still able to survive. This strategy the purple pigeon plays is called *Tit for Tat (TFT)*. This
    behavior has been seen to thrive in both practical and experimental settings, the most famous of which is
    demonstrated in Hamilton's _*Evolution of Cooperation*_. The study follows many of the same features our game
    features so far, just with one big difference - game theorists would actively submit strategies in order to be the
    dominant one. But even with _real humans_ trying to find the optimal strategy, TFT would emerge dominant. Even
    strategies that would actively try to take advantage of TFT would do worse. We can see this demonstrated through the
    _Yellow Pigeon_, which tries to maximize its score by taking TFT into account.

    Model 3 - + Yellow Pigeon

    ```

    And yet, TFT still does better. Wikipedia summarizes _why_ pretty well -

    > Most of the games that game theory had heretofore investigated are "zero-sum" - that is, the total rewards are
    fixed, and a player does well only at the expense of other players. But real life is not zero-sum. Our best
    prospects are usually in cooperative efforts. In fact, TFT cannot score higher than its partner; at best it can only
    do "as good as". Yet it won the tournaments by consistently scoring a strong second-place with a variety of
    partners.[9] Axelrod summarizes this as don't be envious;[10] in other words, don't strive for a payoff greater than
    the other player's."
    The bottom line? Don't be too smart, and play to maximize your own score instead of making your score higher than
    the others.

    ## Chapter Three - Making the simulation more realistic

    Now obviously, as stated earlier, this simulation has a few problems. Beyond the constraints of the fact that it's a
    simulation, and not at all a real experiment, real life has far more factors than what can be reasonably replicated
    in this experiment, specifically humans. Unlike birds, the way humans work is much more sensitive and dynamic. With
    animals, reciprocal altruism is based on _*Kin Selection*_ - A process in which natural selection favors traits
    based on how well they benefit the population and relatives that possess these traits. Thus, altruism operates
    directly under the principle of further survival. With humans however, while kin selection does seem quite the
    appealing explanation, and while families _do_ play a large role in human behavior, we operate _much_ more on our
    own psychologies, in addition to social structures and norms. Take a few of these factors for example:

    - Friendships and Enemies - We like and dislike certain people, and we treat these people differently based on this
    - Morality - Both the moral impulse to punish the cheaters and committing actions that interfere with our moral
    impulses are equally important.
    - Guilt - Cheaters don't just take the rewards into account - They also experience guilt as well, which might
    prevent further cheating.
    - Social influence - A cheater who cheats might cause the cheated to collaborate with others to stop working with
    the cheater.

    Yet, we live in a world where the need for trust becomes more important every day. As stated in the beginning of all
    this, we live in an increasingly competitive world. Even with the increased technologies and opportunities to
    interact with each other, we trust each other less. But even with more trust, to trust all the time is apathy. As
    much as we need trust, we also live in a world where people are increasingly able to win at the expense of others.
    That is, after all, a product of the environment. If anything, TFT teaches us that we have the agency to deal with
    the game of trust. By building relationships, while being diligent, perhaps we can leave the endless cycle of
    competition to the birds.
